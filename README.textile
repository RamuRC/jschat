h2. JSON Chat

h3. Requirements

* eventmachine
* ncurses (for the client)
* json

h3. Usage

* Run the server with <em>./server.rb</em>
* Connect a client with <em>./client.rb</em>

h3. Client commands

* Change name or identify: <code>/nick name</code>
* Join a room: <code>/join #room</code>
* Join a room (alias): <code>/j #room</code>

h3. Protocol design

The protocol is designed to be as close to executable JSON as possible, so clients and servers are simple to implement.

Look at <em>client.rb</em> <code>JsChat::Protocol</code> to see what I mean.
